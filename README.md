# IGDB Feature Store

Repository dedicated to the development and management of the **Feature Store** integrated with the IGDB API. The project organizes, standardizes, and makes video game features available for use in data analysis, pipelines, and machine learning models.

This repository is inspired by and based on the course by **Teo Calvo**, available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhD2YfH6QsU&list=PLvlkVRRKOYFTIPeacwkrA-OVFWwy5unNR).

## Main goals:
- Connect to and collect data from the **IGDB API**.
- Structure and store game features in a scalable format.
- Ensure feature versioning, traceability, and reusability.
- Support integrations with modeling pipelines and analytical systems.
